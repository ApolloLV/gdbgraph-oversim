# gdbgraph-oversim
Implementation of a general de Bruijn graph for the oversim framework

This repo also contains the necessary (outdated) inet-framework/inet and http://www.oversim.org resources.

You will find my code in OverSim/src/overlay/SelfStabilizingGeneralDeBruijnGraph

The protocol itself is detailed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06542
